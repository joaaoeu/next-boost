# next-boost

`next-boost` adds a cache layer to your SSR (Server-Side Rendering) applications. It was built originally for `Next.js` and should work with any node.js `http.Server` based application.

`next-boost` achieves [great performance](#performance) by rendering webpages on `worker_threads` while serving the cached on the main thread.

If you are familiar with `Next.js`, `next-boost` can be considered as an implementation of Incremental Static Regeneration which works with `getServerSideProps`. And it's not meant to be used with `getStaticProps`, in which Next.js will do the cache for you.

```bash
$ npm install next-boost --save
```

## Features

- Drop-in replacement for Next.js's production mode: `next start`
- Greatly reducing the server TTFB (time-to-first-byte)
- Non-blocking main process for cache-serving and using `worker_threads` for SSR
- Simultaneous requests with the first one rendered and the rest served from the cache
- Small footprint with [less than 200 LOC](https://coveralls.io/github/rjyo/next-boost?branch=master)
- Used in production with 300K pages cached
- As a [database-disk-hybrid cache](https://github.com/rjyo/hybrid-disk-cache)
    - no memory capacity limit, and works great on cheap VPSs
    - no need to add a cache layer server like varnish, nginx Cache and etc.
    - great performance, and may even have [better performace than pure file system](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html) cache
    - portability on major platforms

## Use `next-boost` cli with Next.js

After install the package, just change the start script from `next start` to `next-boost`. All `next start`'s command line arguments, like `-p` for specifing the port, are compatible.

```
 "scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "next-boost", // previously `next start`
    ...
  },
```

## Examples

There's an example under `examples/nodejs`, which works with a plain `http.Server`.

To use it with `express.js` and `next.js`, please check `examples/with-express`.


## Performance

By using `worker_threads`, the CPU-heavy SSR rendering will not blocking the main process from serving the cache.

Here are the comparision of using `ApacheBench` on a blog post fetched from database. HTML prerendered and the db operation takes around 10~20ms. The page takes around 200ms for Next.js to render.

```
$ /usr/local/bin/ab -n 200 -c 8 http://127.0.0.1:3000/blog/posts/2020/3/postname
```

Not a scientific benchmark, but the improvements are visibly huge.

with `next start` (data fetched with `getServerSideProps`):

```
Document Length:        76424 bytes
Concurrency Level:      8
Time taken for tests:   41.855 seconds
Complete requests:      200
Failed requests:        0
Total transferred:      15325600 bytes
HTML transferred:       15284800 bytes
Requests per second:    4.78 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       1674.185 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       209.273 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          357.58 [Kbytes/sec] received
```

with the drop-in `next-boost` cli:

```
Document Length:        78557 bytes
Concurrency Level:      8
Time taken for tests:   0.149 seconds
Complete requests:      200
Failed requests:        0
Total transferred:      15747600 bytes
HTML transferred:       15711400 bytes
Requests per second:    1340.48 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       5.968 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.746 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          103073.16 [Kbytes/sec] received
```

It even outperforms next.js's static generated page (`getStaticProps`), handling 2~2.5x requests per seconds in my environment.

## How it works

`next-boost` implements a server-side cache in the manner of [stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/). When an expired (`stale`) page is accessed, the cache will be served and at the same time, a background process will fetch the latest version (`revalidate`) of that page and save it to the cache.

The following config will cache URIs matching `^/blog.*`. Only pages match `rules` will be handled by `next-boost` and there's no `exclude` rules.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  rules: [
    { regex: '^/blog.*', ttl: 300 },
  ],
}
```

There are 2 parameters to control the behavior of the cache:

- `ttl (time-to-live)`: After `ttl` seconds, the cache will be revalidated. And a cached page's `ttl` will be updated when a page is revalidated.
- `tbd (time-before-deletion)`: When a page is not hit again in `ttl + tbd` seconds, it will be completely remove from cache.


Above: only caching pages with URL start with `/blog`.


## Advanced Usages

### Deleting/Revalidating a Single URL

By sending a GET with header `x-cache-status:update` to the URL, the cache will be revalidated. And if the page doesn't exists anymore, the cache will be deleted.

    curl -H x-cache-status:update https://the_server_name.com/path_a

### Batch Deleting/Revalidating

If you want to delete mutiple pages at once, you can run SQL on the cache directly:

```bash
sqlite3 /cache_path/cache.db "update cache set ttl=0 where key like '%/url/a%';"
```

This will force all urls containing `/url/a` to be revalidated when next time accessed.

Deleting `cache_path` will remove all the caches.

### Filtering Query Parameters

By default, each page with different URLs will be cached separately. But in some cases you would like, `/path_a?utm_source=twitter` to be served with the same contents of `/path_a`. `paramFilter` is for filtering the query parameters.

```javascript
// in .next-boost.js
{
  ...
  paramFilter: (p) => p !== 'utm_source'
}
```

### Changing the cache key

By default, the URL will be used as the key for cached pages. If you want to server pages from different domains or by different user-agent, you can use this function to custom the cache key.

Notes:
- If there's any exception thrown from this function, or the returned value is not a `string`, your server will crash.

```javascript
// in .next-boost.js
{
  ...
  cacheKey: (req) => (req.headers.host || '') + ':' + req.url
}
```

### Using rules resolver

Alternatively you can provide a function instead of array inside your config.

```javascript
// in .next-boost.js
{
  ...
  rules: (req) => {
      if (req.url.startsWith('/blog')) {
          return 300
      }
  }
}
```

Function should return valid `ttl` for the request. If the function returns `0` or `falsy` value 
the request will not be cached.

The power that comes from this method is that you can decide if the request is cached or not
more dynamically.

For example you can automatically ignore all request from authenticated users based on the header:

```javascript
// in .next-boost.js
{
  ...
  rules: (req) => {
      if (req.headers.authorization) {
          return false
      }

      return 1000 // cache all other requests for 1 second
  }
}
```

You can also get more complex rules done more easily then through regex. For example you wish different ttl for each of the pagination pages.

```javascript
// in .next-boost.js
{
  ...
  rules: (req) => {
    const [, p1] = url.split('?', 2)
    const params = new URLSearchParams(p1)

    return {
        1: 5000,
        2: 4000,
        3: 3000,
        4: 2000
    }[params.get('page')] || 1000
  }
}
```

While you would need to write complex regex rule or potentially more rules it is easy to
do it through JS logic.

In the end if you prefer writting regex but wish to leverage JS logic you can always regex match inside a rules handler.

## All Configurable Options

If available, `.next-boost.js` at project root will be used. If you use next-boost programmatically, the filename can be changed in options you passed to `CachedHandler`.

tips: If you are using `next-boost` cli with Next.js, you may want to use the config file.

And here's an example [`.next-boost.sample.js`](https://github.com/rjyo/next-boost/blob/master/.next-boost.sample.js) in the repo.


```typescript
interface HandlerConfig {
  filename?: string
  quiet?: boolean
  cache?: {
    ttl?: number
    tbd?: number
    path?: string
  }
  rules?: Array<URLCacheRule> | URLCacheRuleResolver
  paramFilter?: ParamFilter
  cacheKey?: CacheKeyBuilder
}

interface URLCacheRule {
  regex: string
  ttl: number
}

type URLCacheRuleResolver = (req: IncomingMessage) => number

type ParamFilter = (param: string) => boolean
type CacheKeyBuilder = (req: IncomingMessage) => string
```

### Logging

Logging is enabled by default. If you use `next-boost` programmatically, you can disable logs by passing the `quiet` boolean flag as an option to `CachedHandler`.


```javascript
...
const cached = await CachedHandler(args, { quiet: true });
...
```

There's also a `--quiet` flag if you are using the command line.

## Limitations

- For architecture with multiple load-balanced rendering servers, the benefit of using `next-boost` is limited. Until the url is hit on every backend server, it can still miss the cache. Use reverse proxy with cache support (nginx, varnish etc) for that.
- `GET` and `HEAD` requests only.
- `worker_threads` is used and it is a node.js 12+ feature.

## FAQs

### Notice about Next.js's custom server

`next-boost` works as an in-place replacement for `next start` by using Next.js's [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) feature.

On the linked page above, you can see the following notice:

> Before deciding to use a custom server please keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like serverless functions and Automatic Static Optimization.

next-boost is meant to be used on cloud VPS or containers, so serverless function is not an issue here. As to `Automatic Static Optimization`, because we are not doing any `app.render` here, it still works, as perfect as always.

### Why SQLite

Here's the article about [when not to use SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html). And for next-boost's main purpuse: super faster SSR on low-cost VPSs, as far as I know, it is the best choice.
